<h1> Why should I donate blood?</h1>
<ul>
<li> <h4>women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth </h4></li>

<h2>It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.

There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.

Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its
components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</h2>
